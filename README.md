<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project started as hobby learning the basics of raytracing, using typescript.
Probably not the fastest and most effiecent raytracer on the net, but it's still does the job.
The Dialectric material is still buggy and the camera is also can act weirdly when positioned in specific angles.
The whole project is still in development as I'm still learning the fundamentals of raytracing.

### Features
 
 Current features of the raytracer.

* Multiple material handling (Dialectric, Lambertian, Metal)
* Antialiasing
* Depth of field
* Basic sphere object

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add More objects
- [ ] Speed up Rendering (refactor the core raytracer)
- [ ] Better Dialectric material
- [ ] More Material type
- [ ] Better option handling
- [ ] Iteration instead of recursion?
- [ ] Refactor Vector3 class
- [ ] Use GPU instead of CPU
- [ ] Axis aligned bounding box
- [ ] Lighting
